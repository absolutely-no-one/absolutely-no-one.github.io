        "askedBy": "NTh3R, DaughterOfHecate, and SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I mainly chose the name because of the possible jokes.  Eventually people started saying no one, but I can still confuse people with opinions.",

    {
        "question": "Who is your favorite coder?",
        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",

        "question": "What is your favorite game on Hopscotch?",
        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",
        "answer": "That's a very hard decision because there are so many fun games to play on Hopscotch.  I really like the Top Games projects though.",

    {
        "question": "What's your favorite game I made on Hopscotch?",
        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",
        "answer": "I really like your platformer that's in the dark.  I'm pretty sure its called You Are the Light.",

    {
        "question": "Do you like collabs?",
        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",
        "answer": "I kind of like them.  Some have been super fun (such as Team Toucan, when I collabed with Fundardo, tankt2016, and GweTV) while others have not been as fun.",

    },
    {
        "question": "Do you like cookies or brownies?",
        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",
        "answer": "I like both.  If I had to choose one, I would choose brownies.  The fudge brownies are my favorite, and with icing they are perfect.",

        "question": "Coding tips?",
        "askedBy": "DaughterOfHecate",
        "answer": "There are a lot of tips that I would like to share, but I'm only including a couple so this is not long.  The most important tip is not to give up.  If you have a bug in your code, there are a lot of people who would be willing to help.  Ask them if you cannot figure out the problem.  Another tip is to comment or explain your code so that you understand it.  This way, if you take a break, you know what eveything is and do not have to relearn your code.",

        "question": "Do you prefer pixel art or trail art?",
        "askedBy": "Nameless_gamer",
        "answer": "I definitely prefer pixel art.  I have not done much trail art and the attempts I have made have not turned out well.  Though pixel art can be boring, it is very satisfying seeing the image come together.",

    },
    {
        "question": "Do you like apples or bananas more?",
        "askedBy": "Nameless_gamer",
        "answer": "I like apples more.  Bananas can leave a weird aftertaste in my throat, I think it is because of all the potassium but I am not sure.  There are also a lot of different apples, so I can choose which ones I like best.",

    {
        "question": "Do you like Hopscotch or the Hopscotch forum more?",
        "askedBy": "Nameless_gamer",
        "answer": "That's a hard one.  I think, if I had to stop using one, I would stop using the forum.  While it is nice talking to people, I enjoy coding more.  But it is a hard decision and not one I would want to make.",

        "question": "How did you choose your Hopscotch name?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I wanted to choose the name Nobody, but that was taken so I looked for synonyms.  Incognito was also taken, so I added a Mr. to it and now I am Mr. Incognito.",

        "question": "What's your favorite thing about Hopscotch?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I like how you can create anything, but with limits.  The fact that you only have a certain amount of blocks to work with provides a challenge which is always fun.  I also really like the community and how nice it is.",

    },
    {
        "question": "How did you find out about Hopscotch?",

        "question": "What's your favorite thing to code?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios and Mb248",
        "answer": "I like creating games, even though I don't make a lot of them.  They are the most enjoyable to actually make (in my opinion).",

    },
    {
        "question": "What project are you most proud of (inside & outside of Hopscotch) and why?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I don't really know, I think it would be Over and Under because of the effort I put into it.  Outside of Hopscotch I haven't really done much actual coding, I mainly just tinker with stuff.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What's something you hope to learn by continuing to use Hopscotch in the future?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I would like to learn more about how the user interface is designed in most games (e.g. why user information is like a banner at the top of the screen).",

    {
        "question": "What's the coolest block in Hopscotch (in your opinion)?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I like the request seeds block, but all the blue control blocks are cool.",
        "type": "hopscotch"
    },
    {
        "question": "Which block do you use the most?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I think I use variables or check once if blocks the most.  I'm leaning towards variables because I like to use systems (that read strings) to code stuff.",
        "type": "hopscotch"
    },
    {
        "question": "Did you look up to anyone when you first joined?",
        "askedBy": "Mb248",
        "answer": "Yes, I looked up to a lot of Hopscotchers when I joined (and I still look up to them).  Some Hopscotchers I looked up to were Gilbert189, Madi, and MagmaPOP, but they're just a few that I look up to."
