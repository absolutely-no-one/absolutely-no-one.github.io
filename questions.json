        "askedBy": "NTh3R, DaughterOfHecate, and SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I mainly chose the name because of the possible jokes.  Eventually people started saying no one, but I can still confuse people with opinions.",

        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES and mb248",

        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",

        "answer": "There are a lot of tips that I would like to share, but I'm only including a couple so this is not long.  The most important tip is not to give up.  If you have a bug in your code, there are a lot of people who would be willing to help.  Ask them if you cannot figure out the problem.  Another tip is to comment or explain your code so that you understand it.  This way, if you take a break, you know what eveything is and do not have to relearn your code.",

        "askedBy": "Nameless_gamer",
        "answer": "I definitely prefer pixel art.  I have not done much trail art and the attempts I have made have not turned out well.  Though pixel art can be boring, it is very satisfying seeing the image come together.",

        "question": "Do you like apples or bananas more?",
        "askedBy": "Nameless_gamer",
        "answer": "I like apples more.  Bananas can leave a weird aftertaste in my throat, I think it is because of all the potassium but I am not sure.  There are also a lot of different apples, so I can choose which ones I like best.",

        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I like how you can create anything, but with limits.  The fact that you only have a certain amount of blocks to work with provides a challenge which is always fun.  I also really like the community and how nice it is.",

        "question": "Which block do you use the most?",
        "askedBy": "SwimGirlStudios",
        "answer": "I think I use variables or check once if blocks the most.  I'm leaning towards variables because I like to use systems (that read strings) to code stuff.",

        "askedBy": "FRENCH_WAVE123",
        "answer": "I would say around 20 to 30 for actual games.  For pixel arts or music maybe 5.  Sometimes I get lazy and make my code messy by using the same variable for 5 different things even though the name only suits one of the things its being used for.",

        "askedBy": "FRENCH_WAVE123",
        "answer": "I think that one object should control everything related to the object's purpose.  For example, a start screen sprite should control all of the elements of the start screen.  So there is no real concrete number in my opinion.",

If you want the exciting lie, I was sitiing under a tree and tasted a fruit and said: 'this would be a good thing to code,'  Sadly, it went more like me staring at a screen for 20 minutes thinking of themes.",
