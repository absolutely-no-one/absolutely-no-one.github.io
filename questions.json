        "question": "Why did you choose Nobody as a name for the Hopscotch forum?",
        "askedBy": "NTh3R",
        "answer": "I mainly chose the name because of the possible jokes.  Eventually people started saying no one, but I can still confuse people with opinions."

        "question": "Do you like collabs?",
        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",
        "answer": "I kind of like them.  Some have been super fun (such as Team Toucan, when I collabed with Fundardo, tankt2016, and GweTV) while others have not been as fun."

    {
        "question": "Do you like cookies or brownies?",
        "askedBy": "GOATGAMES",
        "answer": "I like both.  If I had to choose one, I would choose brownies.  The fudge brownies are my favorite, and with icing they are perfect."
