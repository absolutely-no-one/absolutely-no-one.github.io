                <p class='text has-text-centered'> My name is Mr. Incognito and this is a website about me.  I code a variety
                  of games on Hopscotch, a kids coding app.  Hopscotch is block-based, meaning you drag and drop blocks to code a
                  project.  I have several curated projects on the app and have been coding on it for 5 years.  I did take a 2 year
                  break in 2016, but other than that I've been active most days on the app.  Below are a couple projects I have coded
                  with Hopscotch.  To play any of them, click the image.

                      <p class='text has-text-centered description'> Counting Stars by One Republic is one of the first music pieces I transposed
                        into Hopscotch.  I have since transposed quite a bit of music into Hopscotch.  A Hopscotch update has let me (and other coders)
                        make transposed music sound a ton better in Hopscotch, as new instruments and more notes were added.

                      <p class='text has-text-centered description'> Over & Under is probably the project that I am most proud of.  It was made
                        for the Hopscotch Seed Developer program, which is a program where coders implement a special block in a project.  The 
                        block allows the coder to earn Seeds, which are Hopscotch's in-game currency.

              <p class='title is-1 has-text-white has-text-centered'> About </p>
              <p class='text has-text-centered'> I am a 13 year old who enjoys programming.  I know Javascript/HTML/CSS, Python, and
                Swift.  I also code with Hopscotch, as I mentioned earlier.  Other than coding, I am interested in sports.  My
                favorite sport to play (and watch) is golf, but I also like basketball and baseball.  There isn't much else to say.
                I'm not very interesting.  If you have questions, ask them on my <a href='https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/nobodys-q-and-or-a/59877/1'> Q&A Topic </a> on the Hopscotch forum.
                I will post answers below.
