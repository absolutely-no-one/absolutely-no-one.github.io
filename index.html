                <p class='text has-text-centered'> My name is Mr. Incognito, and this is a website about me.  I code a variety
                  of games on Hopscotch, a kids coding app.  Hopscotch is block-based, meaning you drag and drop blocks to code a
                  project.  I have several curated projects on the app and have been coding on it for 5 years.  I did take a 2 year
                  break in 2016, but other than that I've been active most days on the app.

                      <p class='text has-text-centered description'> Castle Defender is one of my first large games I made with Hopscotch.  While I do not 
                        think it is great now, I was very proud of it at the time I created it.  It's basically a game where you defend a castle
                        by sending out 'troops', even though the sending mechanism could be improved.
